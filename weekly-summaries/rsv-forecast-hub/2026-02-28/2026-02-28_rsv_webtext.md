# RSV

## Hospital Admissions

* The RSVHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that new weekly laboratory-confirmed RSV hospital admissions will be approximately 7200 nationally, with 4400 to 10200 likely reported in the week ending March 07, 2026.
* This is compared to the 7500 reported for the week ending February 21, 2026, the most recent week of NHSN data.
* Reported and forecasted data as of February 25, 2026.
* The figure shows new weekly laboratory-confirmed RSV hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through February 21, 2026 and forecasted RSV hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through March 14, 2026.

* The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, United States, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.

* This is compared to the 0.57% reported for the week ending February 21, 2026, the most recent week of NSSP data.

* The figure shows the proportion of emergency department visits due to RSV reported in the United States each week from October 01, 2022 through February 21, 2026 and forecasted RSV ED visit proportions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through March 14, 2026.
