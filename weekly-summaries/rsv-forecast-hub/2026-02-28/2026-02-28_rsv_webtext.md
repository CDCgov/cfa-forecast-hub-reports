The RSVHub ensemble predicts that for the week ending March 07, 2026, the weekly percentage of new emergency department (ED) visits due to RSV in the United States will be 0.57% (95% prediction interval 0.33-1%). The median forecast suggests a decrease from 0.57%, which was reported for the week ending February 21, 2026 (the most recent week of reporting).

Ensemble forecasting also predicts that the number of new laboratory-confirmed RSV hospital admissions in the United States during the week ending March 07, 2026 will be approximately 7200 (4400-10200). The median forecast suggests a decrease compared to the 7500 admissions so far reported for the week ending February 21, 2026.

Overview: Forecasted percent of ED visits and new hospital admissions due to RSV. This week, 2 modeling groups contributed 2 forecasts of ED visits and 5 modeling groups contributed 5 forecasts of hospital admissions that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

What does the figure show?: The figure shows the percentage of RSV emergency department visits each week reported from October 01, 2022 through February 21, 2026, number of new laboratory-confirmed RSV hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through February 21, 2026, and forecasted new RSV emergency department visits and hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through March 14, 2026.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, United States, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
