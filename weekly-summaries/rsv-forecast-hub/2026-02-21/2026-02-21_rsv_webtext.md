# RSV

## Hospital Admissions

* The RSVHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that new weekly laboratory-confirmed RSV hospital admissions will be approximately 6200 nationally, with 4100 to 8700 likely reported in the week ending February 28, 2026.
* This is compared to the 6500 reported for the week ending February 14, 2026, the most recent week of NHSN data.
* Reported and forecasted data as of February 18, 2026.
* The figure shows new weekly laboratory-confirmed RSV hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through February 14, 2026 and forecasted RSV hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through March 07, 2026.

* The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Texas, United States, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
