* The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Texas, United States, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
